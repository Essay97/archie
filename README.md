# üóÇÔ∏è Archie

Archie is a command line utility that helps building folder structures based on a template.
You can provide templates based on a configuration file passed in one of the following ways, sorted by priority:

1. `--config <path/to/file>`option
2. `.archierc.yaml` file in current directory
3. `archie.yaml` in global configuration directory
   - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/archie` or `$HOME/.config/archie` on Linux
   - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\archie` on Windows
   - `$HOME/Library/Application Support/archie` on macOS

## üöÄ Installation

### üçª Homebrew

You can install Archie via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you just have to add my tap:

```bash
brew tap essay97/harrysthings
brew update
brew install archie
```

### üì¶ Cargo

If you are a Rust user and are familiar with the tools, you can install Archie directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/archie) using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install archie
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Whatever method you choose to pass the configuration file, the format is always the same: a YAML file with a single root object `templates`.

You define a new template by adding a key to the `templates` object.
A template can contain 2 types of nodes:

- a **folder** node: name ends with a `/`
- a **file** node: no trailing `/`

Compose and nest these 2 types of nodes to shape your templates.

### üåü Example

> Let's say I want to define a template called "example":
>
> ```YAML
> templates:
>  example:            # creates the "example" template
>    foo/:             # creates the "foo" folder
>      hello.txt:      # creates the "hello.txt"
>      my_folder/:     # creates the empty folder "my_folder"
>    bar/:             # creates the "bar" folder at the same level of "foo"
>    file:             # creates the "file" file at the same level of "foo" and "bar"
> ```

Notice that Archie takes into account only the keys of the configuration file, so even files have to be objects, just without body (i.e. with a `null` body).

As a rule of thumb, every YAML element that you want to turn into a file or a folder, has to be followed by a colon.

## üìñ Usage

Your starting point should be `archie help` to have an overview of the functionalities of this tool.
It does these simple things:

- `archie build <path> <template>` creates the folder structure defined by `template` in the given `path`
- `archie list` shows the available templates based on the provided configuration file
- `archie info <template>` shows the structure created by the given `template`. Think of it like some sort of "dry run"

### üåü Example

> Based on the configuration file defined on the previous section:
>
> ```bash
> > archie list
> example
> > archie info example
> example
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bar
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foo
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.txt
> ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_folder
> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file
> > archie build . example
> ## Creates example template in current directory
> ```
